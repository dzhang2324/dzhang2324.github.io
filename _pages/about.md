I am a final year undergraduate student at UC Berkeley studying Statistics and Economics. I am currently studying abroad at National Taiwan University for the 2024-2025 academic year.

I am interested in applying statistics and data science to drive decision making. Specific areas include causal inference, machine learning, and econometrics in economic and medical systems.

I previously worked as a trading intern at Group One Trading. I have also been a freelance music producer, and was a percussionist in the UC Berkeley Symphony Orchestra.

Outside of my technical hobbies, I like to play basketball, powerlift, and make and look for new music. 

I would also like to start writing: this website was created in part to post them online. You can read them in the [Blog section.](https://dzhang2324.github.io/year-archive/)
