I am currently a final year undergraduate student at UC Berkeley studying Statistics and Economics. I am currently studying abroad at National Taiwan University for the 2024-2025 academic year.

My interests are applying statistics and data science methods to inform decision making. In particular, I am interested in machine learning, causal inference, and econometrics for data-driven decision making, especially in economic and medical systems. 

As a UC Berkeley student, I do research in computer vision for radiological applications, and previously have done economic research in health economics and social networks. I have also worked as a Trading Analyst Intern at Group One Trading, and was a freelance music producer.

Outside of my technical hobbies, I like to play basketball, powerlift, and make and look for new music. 

I would also like to start writing: this website was created in part to post them online. You can read them in the [Blog section.](https://dzhang2324.github.io/year-archive/)
